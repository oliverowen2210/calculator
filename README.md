# calculator

A calculator made using HTML, CSS and JS. Made as the final project for the Foundations course in the Odin Project's curriculum.

Took about sixteen and three headaches to make from start to finish, but here it is! It's not the best looking, but hey, it works.

Functional inspiration was the built-in calculator for Windows 10, visual inspiration was a Casio calculator I had lying around.
